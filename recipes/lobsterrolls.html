        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lobster Rolls were created at Perry's, a restaurant in Mildford, Connecticut
            all the way back in 1927, inspired by a similar dish from New England. It's a wonderful summer and winter treat and makes a 
            fancy lunch that will surely impress your friends. You can make this lobster for 
            less than half the price of the ones you could buy in a store or eat in a restaurant, and 
            it's just as delicious, if not better. 
        </p>
